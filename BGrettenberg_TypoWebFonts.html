    <h1>Toy Story stuff</h1>
    <p class="sans-serif">Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy film produced by Pixar Animation
      Studios
      and released
      by Walt Disney Pictures. The feature film directorial debut of John Lasseter, it was the first entirely
      computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by Joss
      Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe
      Ranft.
      The film features music by Randy Newman, was produced by Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, and was
      executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull. It features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles,
      Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von
      Detten. Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot
      focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named Woody and an astronaut action
      figure, Buzz Lightyear, as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner Andy Davis, to
      friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.</p>
    <p class="serif">Following the success of Pixar's 1988 short film Tin Toy, the company was approached by Disney to
      produce a
      computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early
      story
      treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be "edgier". After several disastrous
      story
      reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired:
      "toys
      deeply want children to play with them, and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions". The studio,
      then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial
      constraints.

      In addition to home media and theatrical re-releases, Toy Story-inspired material includes toys, video games,
      theme
      park attractions, spin-offs, merchandise, and three sequels—Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010) and Toy Story 4
      (2019)—all of which garnered commercial success and critical acclaim. A spin-off TV series called Buzz Lightyear
      of
      Star Command aired from 2000 to 2001, starting with a direct-to-video film, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The
      Adventure Begins.</p>
